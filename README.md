This is the code for my talk at the Clojure Berlin December 2018

``` text
How To Travel the World Without Jet lag (Eastman & Burgess, 2009)

Preflight Adjustment to Eastward Travel: 3 Days of Advancing Sleep
with and without Morning Bright Light (Burgess et al., 2003)
```

## To Do

 * Write Readme
 * Choose to display times as local times (origin or destination)
 * Add option to have x days of preparation (and sleep schedule
   change) before departure
 * Search time zones by location?
